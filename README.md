# Artificial-Intelligence

Assignments for the Artificial Intelligence class at USI.

Thanks to Prof. Luca Maria Gambardella for the very interesting course.

This class is about meta-heuristics algorithms on combinatorial optimization problem instances:


**Includes:**

-Iterated Local Search (ILS) for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

-Genetics Algorithms (GA) for Dejong Function Optimization (FO)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm

-Ant Colony System (ACS) for the the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) -> Best algorithm ever created ;)

-Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for The Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW)

P.S. Only the best AI students in the world would know what is the optimal number of ants.
